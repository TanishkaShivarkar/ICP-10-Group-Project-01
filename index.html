    <p>INDIA IS ONE OF the world's most fascinating travel destinations.

There is nothing like your first India trip, your first visit to India. You find out fast that Incredible India really does accurately describe a place that is unlike anywhere else. All of the best India travel tips on earth can only go so far when you're hit with the sensory overload and culture shock that comes with tourism to India. But an India travel guide can help!

    <h4>Where are the best places to visit in India?</h4>
    <p>The best places to visit in India are the ones that call you. They may or may not be the most well-known. Many people feel they have to visit the Golden Triangle Delhi, Agra for the Taj Mahal, and Jaipur on their first trip to India. But you don't. India has amazing places all over the country, some of which are not well publicized.
    <br><br>
    India is called a subcontinent because of the vast range of landscape, geography, and climate. Within the borders of India, you can find the soaring snow-capped peaks of the Himalayas, the desert state of Rajasthan, the lush rainforests of South India, the tropical beaches of Goa, Kerala, Karnataka, and other states, and the jungles of central India, where tigers roam. You can travel in India throughout the year, following the seasons and climate, and never get bored. India is also home to many UNESCO World Heritage sites. You could literally travel around the country visiting incredible heritage sites. </p>
    <br>

    <h4>What are the best destinations and tourist attractions in India?</h4>
    <p>There are so many amazing destinations and tourist attractions to choose from, it's actually hard to know where to begin. A lot of it will depend on your interests. Most people start in the major cities. Make sure you read my extensive Travel Guide to Delhi if you land in the capital to begin your trip. Mumbai is an incredible city to visit, and I also love Varanasi, Amritsar, Rishikesh, Udaipur, and Jaisalmer.
    <br><br>
    Along with an incredible diversity of landscape and climate, India is also incredibly diverse in terms of culture, so I would recommend getting to several different states. They are literally as different from each other as European countries are. My favourite states are Uttarakhand, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Kerala. But of course I also like Goa, Punjab, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Himachal Pradesh, West Bengal, Sikkim, Gujarat, Ladakh, and Odisha. The rest I need to get to!
    <br><br>      
    As for tourist attractions and landmarks, believe it or not, there are many monuments that can compete with the Taj Mahal for the wow factor places like Ellora and Ajanta, Hampi, Mahabalipuram, Khajuraho, the forts and palaces of Rajasthan. There are so many India has an embarrassment of riches when it comes to antiquity. Just have a look at my Landmarks of India post for a sample.</p>

    <h4>How much time do I need to travel in India?</h4>
    <p>The first time I visited to India, I spent six months travelling the length and breadth of the country, and I'm really glad I did. It took me several months just to get my “India legs” and feel confident and comfortable. And it took the entire journey for me to immerse into the culture and begin to get to know it. India is vast, and ancient, and complicated — and every statement you can make about India, you find out eventually the opposite is also true.
    <br><br>
    Having said that, my advice is to take at least 2-3 weeks, preferably a month or two. You won't regret it IF you are one of the people who falls madly in love with India. I also recommend that you don't move around too much. Travel in India is tiring; it really is the ideal destination for slow travel. Pick one or two different regions and sink in. Don't worry about FOMO (fear of missing out): India is always India. You won't miss anything.</p>
    <br>

    <h4>Do I need a Visa to visit India?</h4>
    <p>Yes, you need a Visa to travel in India. <a href="https://breathedreamgo.com/guide-indian-visa-application-tourists/">Click here for for information on obtaining an Indian tourist Visa.</a> </p>
    <br>

    <h4>What is the weather like? Where should I travel by month?</h4>
    <p>Like everything in India, the weather is extreme. And you would be very wise to do some research and plan your trip accordingly. India is a subcontinent, and this means that within the country's borders you can find a very wide range of landscapes, geographies, and climates — from the soaring, snow-covered Himalayas to the dry deserts of Rajasthan, and from the tropical beaches of Kerala to the jungles of Madhya Pradesh. We recommend following the weather when you travel in India, as weather can be extreme. Check out this post The 24 Best places to visit in India by month.

    But, generally speaking the seasons in India follow like this:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Winter: Winter in India is from December to February and it's a pleasant time to be in most parts of the country except the North and the mountains, where it can get very cold and snowy. Be prepared: places like Delhi, Rajasthan, and Rishikesh get COLD in late December and through January. But in tropical South India, winter is perfect.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Shoulder seasons: October and November and February to April are the best times to be in most of India. It can still be cold in the mountains, and rainy in the Northeast, but otherwise, these are the optimum months to visit India.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Monsoon: There are two monsoons in India. There's a monsoon that hits the west coast (Kerala) in early June and travels north — it's the more well-known one. There's another monsoon in the fall that hits the east coast, especially West Bengal and the Northeast. Read: Best monsoon travel destinations in India</li>
        <br>
        <li>Summer. Summer in India is hot. May and June are the two hottest months, with the north and the plains searing. They get some relief when the monsoon hits, but then it becomes humid and sticky. I would avoid India May-to-August if possible, except for the mountains and hill stations. Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, and Uttarakhand are the best states to visit in summer — though the Chardham Yatra in Garwhal, Uttarakhand attracts masses of pilgrims and the roads are clogged with traffic. </li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h4>What Indian festivals should I attend?</h4>
    <p>Indian festivals tend to be big, rowdy, colourful, and rambunctious. And plentiful. There are festivals every day of the year, though many are regional or religious. I live in India and I constantly hear about festivals I’ve never heard of before! The really big festivals, however, are usually pan-India or state-wide. Some are mostly in North India, like Diwali. And some are mostly in South India, like Pongal. 
    <br><br>
    Before you book your trip to India there are a couple of festivals you need to know about — as they can affect traffic and travel. Number one is Diwali, which is basically Christmas in India. Everything shuts down for about three days, and it’s hard to move around. The date changes every year, because it’s based on the lunar calendar, so do check. Same with Holi in North India.</p>
